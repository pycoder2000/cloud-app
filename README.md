This landing page is an open source, generic landing page template built with **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)** and coded entirely with **[React](https://reactjs.org/)**. This webpage is designed to provide all the basic components a developer need to create a landing page for SaaS products, online services, and more. This was followed by this **[YouTube Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVQnhcVFTVs)**. Use it for whatever you want, and be sure to reach me out on **[Twitter](https://twitter.com/lone_Musk)** if you want to build anything cool/useful with it.
